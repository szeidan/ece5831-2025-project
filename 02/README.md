# NumPy Practice — CS231n Python/NumPy Tutorial

This repo contains my practice work while following the **CS231n Python/NumPy Tutorial**.  
The assignment requirements were:
- Use **Jupyter Notebook in VS Code** (no Colab).
- Add headings and explanatory Markdown.
- Submit `numpy-tutorials.ipynb` and a `README.md`.

> **Access:** This repository is **private**. Collaborator access has been granted to my professor and GSI.
